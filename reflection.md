- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    In some ways it feels complicated, like I'm weaving an intricate web and I'll have to be careful to remember how everything is connected. In other ways, though, it makes things simpler because things were already connected in complicated ways in it just breaks thing apart into manageable pieces.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Starting this assignment in class was so so so helpful, and having the README be more fleshed out was also super super helpful. I also started on this assignment earlier than I had with other assignments, and worked around peers to motivate me, which was super helpful. Advice: start assignments early!
